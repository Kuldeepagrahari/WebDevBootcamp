# The Complete Web Development Bootcamp - Course Journey & Projects

## Overview

This repository contains all the projects, assignments, and notes I completed as part of **"The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp"** by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. It documents my learning journey from the fundamentals of HTML to building full-stack applications with a PostgreSQL database.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the skills and concepts I've learned, serve as a personal reference for future projects, and track my progress throughout the course.

## What's Inside

This repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a section or a major project from the bootcamp. You'll find a wide range of technologies and concepts covered, including:

### 1. Frontend Development

The foundation of web development, focusing on creating beautiful and responsive user interfaces.
* **HTML5:** Semantic HTML for structuring web content.
* **CSS3:** Advanced styling techniques, including **Flexbox**, **Grid**, and responsive design principles.
* **Bootstrap 5:** A popular CSS framework for building modern, responsive websites quickly.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core programming logic, **DOM manipulation**, and modern features like `async/await`.
* **jQuery:** A classic library for simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling.
* **React.js:** A powerful JavaScript library for building component-based, single-page applications.

### 2. Backend Development

Building the server-side logic that powers web applications.
* **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
* **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js framework for building robust APIs and web servers.
* **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** A templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages on the server.
* **RESTful APIs:** Designing and building APIs that follow REST principles for clean, scalable communication.

### 3. Databases

Storing, retrieving, and managing application data.
* **SQL & PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database management system. This includes writing complex queries, designing database schemas, and connecting it to a Node.js backend.
* **MongoDB & Mongoose:** While the focus was on PostgreSQL, the course also covered this popular NoSQL database and its ODM.

### 4. Authentication & Security

Implementing secure user authentication and protecting user data.
* **Hashing & Salting:** Securely storing user passwords.
* **Sessions & Cookies:** Managing user login states.
* **OAuth 2.0:** Implementing third-party login with providers like Google and Facebook.

### 5. Tools & Deployment

Essential tools for modern web development.
* **Git & GitHub:** Version control for tracking changes and collaborating on projects.
* **Command Line:** Navigating and managing files and projects efficiently.
* **Deployment:** Deploying full-stack applications to cloud platforms.
